                    <p></p>
                    <p>The most challenging part would probably be making the website responsive. In the beginning of the 
                      project, I felt a bit frustrated on understanding and applying the concepts of media queries, and 
                      responsive layout. After searching for explanations in YouTube and reading through tutorials in 
                      W3Schools, I’ve felt a lot more comfortable with the concepts. In the actual coding, I’ve made use of 
                      Bootstrap5 framework to easily manipulate the layout, for example hiding elements in the navigation bar 
                      when the screen size is small or adjusting the number of columns on the webpage as the screen size 
                      changes. It was good to see myself starting from scratch to create a website that I think is good looking 
                      and be able to record my career journey with a personalized site. I found all the challenges that I faced 
                      in the project helped me to grow my skills and knowledge in web development!</p>

                    The project aims to create a task tracking mobile application (i.e. a TO-DO App) that have a login screen and a task screen. The
                    login screen allows user input validation, and the task screen enables task storage. Here's a simple demo to it:

                  <p></p>
                  <p>The biggest challenge that I’ve faced in that 2 months was probably when I tried to use SQLite to
                    store the tasks that user input to a database. I had spent so much time writing the code, debugging what’s 
                    warnings with my program. It was really frustrating for those 2 weeks. I just kept getting errors, getting 
                    warnings, and the App just didn’t work as expected at all. I got really stuck and didn’t know how to fix it. 
                    And so I’ve tried to ask for help from Dave and Waqas who are my mentor and buddy,
                    and they just guided me through it, reviewing my code, showing me how we could do the trials and
                    errors, figuring out which part of the code was wrong by commenting some parts out(i.e. the debugging mindset) 
                    and also, they’ve explained some new concepts (e.g. Promises,
                    Async Functions) which I found it quite difficult to understand and also some common practices (e.g. normally
                    how data is stored by a developer). And in the end, everything worked well, and I really enjoyed that feeling of
                    satisfaction. I hope I could have more opportunities to try using databases in my projects!</p>

                    This project is assigned by a viAct.ai AI Engineer as my internship task. I was given a classification model file in onnx format, 
                    and was asked to create a model inference workflow in Python. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the code, I have created a function that takes in an image of a person, preprocess it to the required format, 
                    pass it to the classification model, and apply a softmax function on the output which represents the probabilities 
                    of a person wearing a helmet, a person without helmet, and undetermined respectively.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to that, I have created a task scheduled at 2am every day using Prefect, which it would first look at 
                    the user-specific directories where all the images are located, then perform inference on each of the images found 
                    in the directory with the function created, and save the inference results in json format. And in the end, it would 
                    move all the processed images to user-specific directories after the inference.

                    like prefect, json, os, pathlib, etc. I started all of them from reading through the documentations, and tried to 
                    figure out the code individually. The full list of tech stack used are as shown below:

                  <p>I found all parts of it challenging since I had totally no idea what I should do as I received the task from 
                    my supervisor. Many of the tools mentioned in the task description are new to me, and I started all from scratch. I 
                    was really lost at that time, but eventually, after dividing it into smaller parts (e.g. learning about onnxruntime first, 
                    then prefect, then file import and export, ...), I was able to find out a solution for the problem, and accomplished 
                    the task in the end. I found it a very fruitful learning experience!

                    In the game, there are 3 difficulty levels, easy, medium, and hard, with fewer lives accordingly. Player 1 would write down a word 
                    for Player 2 to guess, and player 2 would guess it until his/her lives are all used up. I've used the Python library 'Turtle' to 
                    create a graphical interface for a better gaming experience for the users. Here's a simple demo to it:

                  <p>The biggest challenge of this project was to create a graphical interface using turtle. It was hard to 
                    know which coordinates the turtle has to goto in order to create a good looking interface. In the end, I 
                    managed to do it by first designing the graphics on a graph paper online, and code it accordingly.

                    This project started with the purpose of getting hands-on experience on Android mobile application development after self-learning 
                    Kotlin and app development during 2021 Winter, and for being able to revise course materials on phone with a nicely designed app.

                    I started like a blank sheet of paper, so initially I got lost on where to start learning with. There were too many things needed to learn 
                    to build a good application, for example I have to know about the 4 basic app components: Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and 
                    Content Providers, and then about app architecture of how to divide an app into UI and Data layers, how to do debugging, how to write unit 
                    and intrumental tests, how to do navigation, etc. I also have to learn a new language - Kotlin, because from my research, Google had announced 
                    that Kotlin would be the official language for Android, and I would like to follow the latest trend. All of these make the learning progress tough, 
                    not only I have to keep my motivation up, but also I have to plan my learning process step by step, and implement the plan well. I am so proud 
                    that I was able to make a cool looking Android application, and I think project planning would have been the most challenging part of this project.

                     This project was the 1st course project for 'Advanced Data Mining for Risk Management and Business Intelligence'. The aim is to perform sentiment 
                     analysis and rank the attitude of the review data set from 1 to 5. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Firstly, explorative data analysis was performed in the beginning of the project, for example 
                     checking if the data is balanced, characteristics of review data (e.g., UPPERCASE, punctuations, tagging, etc.), frequency of N-gram, correlation between 
                     features and label using correlation matrix, and exploring the distribution of reviews' word count, sentence count, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then 4 different model architectures were experimented, including 1-layer perceptron, CNN, RNN, and RNN-CNN. Tuning was conducted on features and 
                     hyperparameters to improve the model performance. In the end, our group has passed the strong baseline given by our instructor, which is with a Macro-F1 score 
                     of 0.5609 (> 0.5370).

                    This project could be said to be my first project to do all procedures in machine learning training. From feature extractor, 
                    to explorative data analysis, then to training 4 different model architectures, hyperparameters tuning, and performance 
                    evaluation. The whole process was challenging because I was unfamiliar with coding to do machine learning tasks. Therefore, this 
                    project had really given me a very good hands-on experience in machine learning, and I was so obsessed with it and keep trying it 
                    for the whole week for more than 10 hours a day!

                    This project was the 2nd course project for 'Advanced Data Mining for Risk Management and Business Intelligence'. The aim of 
                    this project is to perform link prediction between 2 users in a social network, which link prediction is done by computing node 
                    (user) similarity in the embedding space. Model performance was evaluated by the AUC-ROC score.

                    The most challenging part of the project is to visualize the performance of different models during the hyperparameters tuning process. Since 
                    I wanted to tuning multiple hyperparameters all at once for less human monitoring effort during tuning, heatmap was not enough to visualize 
                    the models' performance. In the end, after some researches, I was able to construct a parallel coordinates plot using the plotly library, and 
                    it was a rewarding process!

                    predict user ratings on items based on available ratings. We had trained and tuned 2 model architectures: Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) and Wide 
                    and Deep Learning (WDL). Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was used to evaluate our prediction performance.

                    Our group's final model was the NCF model with epoch = 1, embedding size = 5, and output layer using multi-layer perceptron. We achieved an RMSE of 1.0568 
                    (&#60; strong baseline 1.09) on the validation set.

                    This project was challenging, not because of the task, but because we had a poor mindset in the beginning of our project. 
                    In our course, we have learnt both the NCF and the WDL models, but in our project, we once ignored the NCF model because 
                    the WDL model used much more features and we thought that it would give a better model performance. We were exhausted in tuning 
                    the WDL model to meet the baseline provided by our instructor and we were far away from that even there was only 1 day left 
                    before the project deadline. In the end, one of my groupmate realized that using the NCF model could easily pass the baseline, 
                    and we were shocked. This project had taught me that complex model does not equal to good performance, in practical tasks, we 
                    have to consider which model suits our problem, but not how complex it is. I have learnt that, sometimes, simple is the best.

                    actual demand. One solution to it is to turn on small Peaker or Peaking Power Plants which is of high cost per kilowatt 
                    hour, and another is to buy expensive power from another grid. In order to make better economic trade-offs about the 
                    number of peaker plants to turn on or whether to buy from another grid, the grid operator would like to know an estimation 
                    of the power output of a peaker power plant (while this would depends on the environmental conditions).

                    The most challenging part in this assignment was to understand the key concepts since some of the terms used in the assignment 
                    was not taught during class, and some of them were not appeared in machine learning in a non-cloud environment. For example, I have 
                    to read through the documentation to understand the concept of Transformer, which is an algorithm that transform a DataFrame into another 
                    DataFrame (i.e. a ML model), or an Estimator, which is an algorithm that can be fit on a DataFrame to produce a Transformer (i.e., learning 
                    algorithm that trains on DataFrame to produces a model). On the other hand, learning the API for spark like ParamMap and VectorAssembler 
                    was also a bit challenging and fun XD

                    <b>Problem Description: </b>COVID-19 first identified in 2019 has now fully grown to become a global pandemic that caused 
                    vast and irreparable devastation to all parts of the world. Though with the development of vaccination and by doing mask-wearing 
                    and social-distancing etc., situations have improved, however, there still a long road ahead of us before we can truly rid ourselves 
                    of the disease. It is important for us to learn from the past data, and understand the current situation in order to adopt the best 
                    measures to fight against the disease. Hence, our project is to analysis the global COVID-19 data and gain insights from it.

                    I think the most challenging part of the project was to gain insights from the tables and charts obtained through coding and to write the report. 
                    It was not difficult to extract the information we wanted from the dataset, because simply by understanding the API could do the job. However, extracting 
                    meaningful information and explaining the reasons behind the information we obtained was the hardest part. In this project, I realized the importance 
                    of good English writing skills. I was responsible in the coding part, and I tried to write a draft report just to explain what I've got from my code 
                    to my groupmates. They have write another one on top of mine, and their report was far better than mine because they explain everything much clearly, 
                    more organized, and with more accurate vocabularies. After this project, I saw the need of further improving my language skills and that was the biggest 
                    reward from this project.

                    The most challenging part of the project is understand the whole flow of the skeleton code given by the course instructor. Since 
                    assembly language is less readable compare with high-level programming language, spending time to understand and create a program 
                    flow chart is quite time-consuming. However, by being patient and read the code step by step, it was still manageable.

                    The most challenging part is to learn using Linux command line for establishing connections with and between different instances since I 
                    was not familiar with Linux. Besides, I had also struggled a lot to learn how to use SysBench for doing measurement, and understanding 
                    the output of the code. For example, to measure the CPU performance of the instance, SysBench is trying to calculate prime numbers up to 
                    10000 within 10 seconds, and I have to figure out which figure to look at in order to compare the CPU performances of different instances (i.e., 
                    the CPU speed - representing how many times it calculated prime number up to 10000 within 10 seconds). Since I haven't learnt anything about 
                    CPU, memory, and networking at that time, I had struggled to understand what SysBench was doing. However, after some struggles, I was able to 
                    complete the tasks, and it was fulfilling.

                    This is the research project that I have taken in the summer of 2022. 
                    The research topic is: Evaluation of FinBERT Performance on Multi-Class ESG Classification Task based on the MSCI Framework.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Supervised by Professor Huang Allen Hao and Professor Yang Yi, and with the help of Postgraduate students Miss Hui Wang and 
                    Mr. Srijith Kannan, I have completed the research on the evaluation of FinBERT performance for multi-class ESG classification. 
                    The project included longer than one month of data labelling process, and another month for model fine-tuning process. It was 
                    a valuable experience which allows me to write up data preprocessing, training, fine-tuning, and evaluation code for as many 
                    as 11 machine learning models. These ML models include Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Random Forest, MLP, CNN, 
                    LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, GRU, BERT, and FinBERT, where FinBERT is a Large Language Model developed this year that adapts to 
                    financial texts.

                  <p>
                    Through the project, besides the ML part, it was also a fresh experience to be labelling such a huge amount of data. I was 
                    responsible to ensure the data label quality, and it was a tough work. However, I enjoyed it a lot because I could make 
                    use of this opportunity to force myself reading company's CSR reports and understand more about different company's ESG operations.

                    The most challenging part is to prepare the code for BERT fine-tuning. It is because I have never learnt about BERT model before, and 
                    I have never used PyTorch before too, it had taken me some time to understand the process of loading the model and tokenizer, as well 
                    as defining training arguments for fine-tuning. The problem was solved unexpectedly easy because supervisor had provided a sample code 
                    of fine-tuning FinBERT model, and in the end, only a few amendment in the sample code is needed for fine-tuning BERT. Although the 
                    solution was simple, but it has led me to do a lot of research on the BERT model, and gain some basic knowledge about it. It was a 
                    rewarding learning process and I enjoyed a lot!

                    This is a commercial project that I have developed through collaborating with our HKUST RMBI + COSC alumnus Hayden Chiu during the summer of 2022. 
                    The project aims to facilitates musicians to flip their sheet music during their musical performance without the need to bother flipping it 
                    by hand while worrying about how this would affect their performance. It makes use of the Computer Vision technology to enable users flipping 
                    their sheet music by simple head gesture like nodding head or winking eyes.

                    I was responsible for the settings page, icon, splash screen, and notification layouts and functionalities. In particular, I have had practical 
                    experience in using the PreferenceScreen, setting locale, themes, sending intent, etc. On the other hand, I am also responsible for collecting data 
                    related to head gesture, for the training of machine learning model. Although I was not responsible for the model training part, but we have meetings 
                    sharing our development process with each other for learning purpose. It was a great learning experience, and I have learnt the whole process of embedding 
                    computer vision technologies to android mobile application development, from data collection, to training models, and deployment. It was fun, and I

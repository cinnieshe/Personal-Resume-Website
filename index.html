                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Cinnie. Thank you for coming to my personal website. 
                    This website is coded from scratch by me with HTML5, CSS3, and 
                    Bootstrap5, and it is responsive! I'm currently a Year 2 student 
                    in HKUST, majoring in Risk Management and Business Intelligence 
                    (RMBI). Feel free to contact me any time and I'm looking forward 
                    to seeing you!
                </p>

            <h3>My Passion & Career Target</h3>
            <p>I like accepting challenges and tackling problems that could be systematically solved. 
                That's why I'm interested in mathematics related electives when I was in secondary school 
                (I took BAFS, Economics, Physics, and M2 in Form 4-6). In university, I get in touch with 
                Python in my first year of study, I’d fun with it and I become interested in programming thereafter. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m passionate in exploring the tech world, learning how to program a website or an application 
                that is functional. I found creating something that would convenient people’s lives meaningful 
                and satisfying. Hence, my career target is to become a software engineer who could help businesses 
                to improve their customer services or make their business operations more efficient.

                <p>
                    I graduated from Po Leung Kuk No.1 W.H. Cheung College in 2019 and have been receiving education 
                    in HKUST since then. In my Year 1-2 studies, my CGA was 3.326. Here are the courses that I've taken 
                    in these 2 years as a RMBI student.

                        background in Computer Science and they only hire for experienced engineer.

                        The task that they had given to me is about creating a model inference workflow with Prefect, you could 
                        check it out in the GitHub repository here: 
                        <span><a href="https://github.com/sfwing1126/task_1.git" target="_blank">Go to GitHub</a></span>. Before they gave me this 
                        task, I had no idea what Onnx model and Prefect are, and I had never tried loading and saving files in 
                        local computers through code. I’ve learnt about how to create a workflow, how images are pre-processed 
                        and how to use different libraries all by myself during the internship. I found this internship meaningful 
                        since it had given me an opportunity to learn and practice, and I’ve learnt more about some common practices, 
                        including managing a GitHub repository and creating a readme mark down file.

                        This internship experience is really rewarding. They had given me chances to learn about different 
                        AI topics, including image segmentation, human detection/human pose estimation, multiple object 
                        tracking, depth estimation, accurate temperature measurement, and thermal image-based method. 
                        Through the journey, I’ve read through some research papers in different areas which have given 
                        some insights on the recent AI industry development. And I’ve been given a chance to train an AI 
                        model based on an existing GitHub model with a new synthetic dataset. In the technical aspect, 
                        I’ve really learnt a lot.

                        For non-technical part, during the internship, I was able to see the difference between university 
                        programming, and real-world programming. In university, most projects are guided with instructions 
                        and there are lots of assumptions, but in real business situation, we have to consider these 
                        assumptions too. Hardware, environmental parameters are also in the considerations during the product 
                        development. Besides that, during the internship, I was able to see how teams work together, having 
                        regular meetings, how the CEO leads the company and teams and discover new directions for product development. I 
                        was able to find my way to contribute in work and it was a fruitful learning experience for me.

                    <p>I was mentored by Dave Ip and Waqas Ali from Credit Suisse throughout my project on creating 
                        a task tracking mobile application. Here is a simple demo for the product of this 10-week 
                        mentorship program: <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726Rgcu0mYA" target="_blank">Go to YouTube</a></span>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the beginning of the program, I knew nothing about software engineering. It was my first 
                        time to dive into this area, and I had no idea on how to use JavaScript, React/React Native, 
                        Expo, GitLab, and SQLite. Everything started from scratch, starting from learning about sprint, 
                        for instance how a project is managed, refreshing my memory about Git and learning about GitLab, 
                        for example how to do the merging, how to view logs, etc. Also, I had tried to use CI/CD pipeline 
                        so that I could have my application published automatically after pushing it to the remote 
                        repository. In addition, I’ve gone through some basics of JavaScript and ES6, which is an entirely 
                        new language for me, learning from as simple as logging something on the console, to looking at 
                        concepts like Promises and Async Functions, etc. Apart from that, I think trying with mobile app 
                        development is also very interesting, using Expo and React, React Native to construct an application, 
                        like seeing what I’ve code on a real smartphone screen is really satisfying. All the concepts like 
                        components, states are so new to me, so when I success to use the useState function to store the 
                        error message for example, and makes it pop up and refresh on the screen, I was so happy, and I 
                        really like that feeling of satisfaction. Besides, I’ve also tried with Expo SQLite to store like 
                        the username and password, and also the tasks, trying to understand how data are stored, how queries 
                        are made and how to use callbacks to re-render the application. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the non-technical perspective, I’ve received a lot of career advice from Dave and Waqas. 
                        Able to know how to prepare to become a software engineer is rewarding. And I was also able to 
                        see them doing the debugging for me during the live Zoom meeting. Seeing how a real developer 
                        do the coding is very beneficial to my learning.

                    <p>Supervised by Professor LEE Yi-Kuen and with the help of Mr. Izhar, I finished the UROP
                        Program successfully last summer. Due to my limited 
                        knowledge and skills in Year 1, I was responsible solely for data collection using their 
                        developed Android App. The app functions similar to an accelerometer and a gyroscope, and 
                        I used it for taking related data on different human activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, I am passion about knowing more about the AI and Machine Learning technology. 
                        Therefore, I searched for YouTube machine learning courses so that I could try to build the 
                        machine learning model for human activities classification myself. I gained some basic knowledge
                        on deep learning, neural networks, computer vision, and NLP using Tensorflow. With this 
                        effort, I still face quite a lot of difficulties in creating the model. I sought advice
                        from my supervisor, and they gave me guidance on preprocessing the data, and gaining insights
                        from it. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish the machine learning model before the program 
                        period ended, but I still gained valuable experience from it.

                        I'm current a team memeber of HKUST Table Tennis Team. I've represented HKUST in USFHK 
                        Table Tennis Competition. It's really fun to play table tennis with my friends and hang out 
                        with people with the same hobby!

                        Apart from coding, and playing table tennis, I also like to write my own songs in my spare time. 
                        I've joined the Christmas Singing Contest with my classmate held in my secondary school with 
                        my original song! And we ended up getting the 2nd runner-up in group singing! It was an unforgettable 
                        experience to sing in front of the whold school.

                    <p>
                        I've been playing table tennis for 10 years and have been the team member of my primary and 
                        secondary schools, as well as HKUST. I have been in the Heng Seng Jing Ying Team which is right 
                        below the Hong Kong Youth Team when I was in Form 4. I enjoy playing table tennis so much!

                    <p>
                        Learning coding is really fun. I enjoy being so focus on a single project at night, and end up 
                        finishing it after so many trials and errors. Even though I do not have a Computer Science background, 
                        but I really like to use my spare time to learn about different programming languages as well as 
                        industry practices. I really hope that I could be able to pursue a career as a software engineer!
